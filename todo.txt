parser todo:
- operator precedence

todo:
- !!! deallocate stuff in loops
- reference parameters / variables / outputs
- unbounded ranges
- error if core library not found
- effect associated types
- effect associated handlers
- dynamic effects (less powerfull, but are ONE type for every handler)
- anonymous effects (are always dynamic)
- separate types in sema::Type according to their Kind

would be nice:
- tokenizer matches brackets
- seperate token from data
- custom anchor tokens per Parse instance
