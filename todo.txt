typechecking todo:
- fail type in handlers
- fail type of implicit handlers/naked handler calls (and only allowed in try blocks if they fail!)
- handler function must match signature
- functions that return handlers must not be (mutually) recursive
- functions must not be (mutually) recursive through try blocks

parser todo:
- operator precedence

todo:
- !!! deallocate stuff in loops
- unbounded ranges
- fail in try blocks
- opaque types (they will be view types)
- error if core library not found

would be nice:
- tokenizer matches brackets
- seperate token from data
- custom anchor tokens per Parse instance

working on:
- separate generation code from data types
- analyzer gives semantic IR
- try blocks no longer their own function
